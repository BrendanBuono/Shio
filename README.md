# Shio 2D HTML5 Video Game Engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrendanBuono/Shio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BrendanBuono/Shio)

 Shio is a 2D HTML5 Video Game engine written from scratch. It has very few third party libraries (mostly for doing heavy math related stuff) and has been built as a learning excercise. Currently Shio is not fully functional, but hopefully one day it will be. If you are interested in contributing to Shio, please submit a pull request. If you have quesitons about Shio, you can reach the maintainer at brendan.buono@gmail.com
